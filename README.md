# TomatoCastle Dataset

*The paper is being revised with an improved synthetic dataset for generalization in tomato leaf disease and fruit detection. We plan to add the trained weights and second dataset afterwards.*

The paper is avaliable at <arxiv link\>.

The dataset is licensed under a CC-BY-NC-4.0. It is intended for non-generative AI research and non-commercial use due to assets used in simulation.

We public the compressed version of the dataset with 16-bit depth and 95\% quality RGB on [HuggingFace (160GB)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/XingjianLi/tomatotest). *Note: 23 pairs were corrupted during data collection or preprocessing, see `corrupted_h5.txt`*

The original rendered 32-bit depth and PNGs is on [Globus (750GB)](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=b2e1b583-53be-4933-9d4f-70c83425bb79&origin_path=%2F). Note: The differences between the two is in sub-millimeters.

The packaged UE5 simulator environment is on [Globus (3.84GB)](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=4d656862-689a-49e3-b8e8-cb54bcab3767&origin_path=%2F).
